# MetaChan

Metachan is an attempt to create a complete and cohesive anime and manga metadata database by collecting and aggregating data from various sources. The goal is to provide a comprehensive and accurate database that can be used by developers, researchers, and fans to access information about anime and manga.

This repository contains code for the Metachan API, which provides a RESTful interface for accessing the metadata database and the Metachan Sync tool, which is used to synchronize data from various sources into the database.

This project is still in the early stages of development and further documentation will be updated soon.
